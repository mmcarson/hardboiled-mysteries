                <p>It's New Year's Eve of 1920, and a new era of chaos is reigning here in the USA. Prohibition has been in full swing since January 17th, and everything considered vice has gone deep underground. Al Fresco, owner of the Fizzy Lemon, doesn't
                    let the law stop Chicago from partying. But everyone has secrets. Can this speakeasy survive the night?</p>

            <h2>How We Run Our Parties</h2>
            <p>At Hardboiled, we begin the night with everyone alive and well. You get to know the characters first&mdash;everyone has things to do and people to see. Then, once everyone has become acquainted with one another (and gotten a chance to eat),
                someone gets MURDERED. It's up to the guests to figure out which one of them did it&mdash;and yes, it could be you!</p>
            <article>
                <h3>Instructions for guests</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Sign up for either a main (named and essential part of the story) character or a supporting (mostly observer/investigative character who may have a name or just a category such as Gangster) character. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/o/hardboiled-mysteries-28119730827"

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founder Marissa Carson had been throwing murder mysteries and other theme parties for fun over the years and decided one day to make them open to the public. Her goal in creating Hardboiled was to produce fully immersive, solvable mysteries
                that encourage people to get to know others around them&dash;except as someone else.</p>
