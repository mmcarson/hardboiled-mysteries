            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founder Marissa Carson had been throwing murder mysteries and other theme parties for fun over the years and decided one day to make them open to the public. Her goal in creating Hardboiled was to produce fully immersive, solvable mysteries
                that encourage people to get to know others around them&dash;except as someone else.</p>
